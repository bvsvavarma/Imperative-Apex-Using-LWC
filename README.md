 # Imperative-Apex-Using-LWC

**Call Apex Methods Imperatively**

1. To control when the method invocation occurs (for example, in response to clicking a button), call the method imperatively.
2. Call an Apex method imperatively as opposed to using @wire.
3. To call a method that isn't annotated with cacheable = true, which included any method that inserts, updates, or deletes data.
4. To control when the onvocation occurs.
5. To work with objects that aren't supported by User Interface API, like Task and Event.
